# SIGNAL_PLAYGROUND

4_EMERSON, Electronics Learning Board
A small interactive PCB I designed as a hands-on electronics toy for my niece.
An educational analog hardware project.

•	Resistor = brightness control
•	Capacitor = smoothing
•	Inductor = energy storage

Press the switches and watch how each component changes the LED response in real time.

Key Features
•	Interactive LED response to different passive components
•	Dedicated channels for resistors, capacitors, and inductors
•	Through-hole component interfaces for easy experimentation
•	Custom silkscreen artwork and educational labeling
•	2-layer PCB with ground plane for noise reduction

Hardware Design
•	CAD: KiCad
•	Power: 2xAA battery holder (3V)
•	Grounding: Top & Bottom copper pour with stitched ground vias
•	Input Path: Noise-optimized routing with short trace to input capacitor
